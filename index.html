				<h1>Places – Premises – Channels</h1>
				<p>Channels are interpreted to be inclusive of all environments, locations, and mechanisms in the delivery of a service for the organisation. Physical Channels, Internet, Mobile and social media are major contributory factors of the customer’s overall impression and experience of the organisation and act as important attractors to new customers.</p>
				<p>Channels should be easily accessible, easy to use, secure and available always from any access point for all user segmentation including people with disabilities.</p>
				<h4>ASSESSMENT OF CHANNEL ENVIRONMENTS - 15 points</h4>
				<p>The organisation should conduct a general risk assessment of all delivery channels from which the organisations operate. In addition, an organisation workplace assessment should be done at regular intervals to ensure suitable environment for its employees involved in the delivery of the services.</p>
				<h4>Success Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>i. Assessment of occupational health and safety risks for all delivery channels;</p>
				<p>ii. An overall risks and issues register should be made available to all relevant parties.</p>
				<p>Once you complete the assessment, our team will analyze the results and provide you with a detailed report. This report will include insights and recommendations to help you achieve customer experience excellence.</p>
